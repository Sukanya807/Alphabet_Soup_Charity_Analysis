# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview & Purpose

The purpose of this project is to use machine learning and neural networks and create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting if the applicants that will be funded by a Charitable Organization called 'Alphabet Soup' will be successful. The dataset used for this analysis contains various measures on 34,000 organizations that have been funded by Alphabet Soup. The project includes three steps -

- Preprocessing the data for the neural network
- Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model
- Optimizing the model

## Resources
- Neural Network and deep learning
- Python - Pandas, Tensorflow, ScikitLearn
- Jupyter Notebook
